  Development in progress

  3D printer enclosure temp monitor software for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. To be used with 18B20 temperature sensor and a 16x2 Character LCD Display with an I2C adapter

  When it's development is finished it will save the temperatures at different times to a database at a central server (for me it's a Raspberry Pi 4 running OctoPrint).
